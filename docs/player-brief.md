Theron: Legends of the Hex Lands — Player Overview
==================================================

What the game is
----------------
- A hex-based village builder/survival sim where villagers act autonomously.
- You guide by painting priorities, placing blueprints, and assigning roles—then watch them execute.
- Procedural worlds: rivers, forests, mountains, and resources change every run.

Quick loop (5 steps)
--------------------
1) Look around: pan/zoom, spot fertile land, forests, and stone.  
2) Paint priorities: farm on fertile tiles, mine on hills, gather on forests.  
3) Assign roles: farmers to food, workers to construction/hauling, warriors to defense, scouts to explore.  
4) Build: place granary/warehouse/house early; temple for Faith later; towers for defense.  
5) React to events: migrants, droughts, beasts/raiders—adjust roles, speed, and priorities.

Roles at a glance
-----------------
- **Farmer**: sows, fertilizes, harvests farm tiles.  
- **Worker**: hauls resources, builds structures.  
- **Warrior**: patrols defend zones and fights threats.  
- **Scout**: explores fog to reveal resources and threats.  
- **Devotee**: worships at temples to generate Faith (unlocks after building a temple).  
- Children/elders: non-assignable; children grow into adults over time.

Buildings & resources
---------------------
- Stockpile caps grow with buildings: granary (food), warehouse (wood/stone), houses (population).  
- Temple unlocks devotees and Faith generation; campfire boosts morale; tower extends vision/defense.  
- Keep food steady first, then expand wood/stone for mid-game builds.

Threats & events
----------------
- Weather: rain boosts crops/forests, drought slows growth and increases hunger.  
- Travelers: may join (friendly) or attack (hostile).  
- Beasts/raiders: mark defend zones and keep warriors ready; towers help spot and soften threats.

Controls (essentials)
---------------------
- Pan: WASD/arrow keys or middle-drag. Zoom: mouse wheel / +/− buttons.  
- Priorities: hotkeys F farm, M mine, G gather, E explore, B build, Esc clear.  
- Speed: 1× / 2× / 5× buttons; pause button in HUD.  
- Click portraits to select and focus a citizen; hover cells for tooltips.

Token basics (optional)
-----------------------
- Faith is earned in-game via devotees/temples.  
- You can convert Faith to HEX on-chain via OneWallet when ready; THERON is the premium token.  
- Not required to enjoy the core loop—play the city-builder freely.

Tips to start strong
--------------------
- Set farms on the best fertility near water; build a granary early.  
- Keep 1–2 warriors once threats start; drop a tower for vision.  
- Use scouts to reveal more resources before over-expanding.  
- Adjust roles often; idle workers can be reassigned to the current bottleneck.
